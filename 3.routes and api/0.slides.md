### Detailed Content

#### 1. Introduction to Rails Routing

- **Slide Title:** Introduction to Rails Routing
- **Content:** 
  - Briefly explain what routing is and its role in directing HTTP requests to controller actions.
  - Mention that routing is crucial for defining the endpoints of a web application.

#### 2. Basic Routing

- **Slide Title:** Basic Routing
- **Content:**
  - **Simple Route:**
    ```ruby
    get 'welcome/index'
    ```
    - Explain that this maps the URL `/welcome/index` to the `index` action in the `WelcomeController`.
  - **Root Route:**
    ```ruby
    root 'welcome#index'
    ```
    - Mention that this sets the root URL (`/`) to the `index` action of `WelcomeController`.

#### 3. Resourceful Routing

- **Slide Title:** Resourceful Routing
- **Content:**
  - **Single Resource:**
    ```ruby
    resources :articles
    ```
    - Show the standard RESTful actions generated (`index`, `show`, `new`, `edit`, `create`, `update`, `destroy`).
  - **Nested Resources:**
    ```ruby
    resources :articles do
      resources :comments
    end
    ```
    - Explain nested routes like `/articles/:article_id/comments`.

#### 4. Advanced Routing

- **Slide Title:** Advanced Routing
- **Content:**
  - **Custom Routes:**
    ```ruby
    get 'articles/:id/publish', to: 'articles#publish', as: 'publish_article'
    post 'articles/:id/unpublish', to: 'articles#unpublish'
    ```
    - Describe custom routes and how they can be named.
  - **Member and Collection Routes:**
    ```ruby
    resources :articles do
      member do
        get 'preview'
        post 'publish'
      end
      collection do
        get 'archived'
      end
    end
    ```
  - **Using Concerns:**
    ```ruby
    concern :commentable do
      resources :comments
    end
    resources :articles, concerns: :commentable
    resources :photos, concerns: :commentable
    ```
  - **Constraints:**
    ```ruby
    constraints(id: /[A-Z]\d{5}/) do
      resources :products
    end
    ```
  - **Namespaces:**
    ```ruby
    namespace :admin do
      resources :articles
    end
    ```
  - **Scoping:**
    ```ruby
    scope path: 'api', defaults: { format: :json } do
      resources :articles
    end
    ```
  - **Shallow Routes:**
    ```ruby
    resources :articles, shallow: true do
      resources :comments
    end
    ```
  - **Mounting Engines:**
    ```ruby
    mount Blog::Engine, at: '/blog'
    ```

#### 5. Named Routes

- **Slide Title:** Named Routes
- **Content:**
  - Example:
    ```ruby
    get 'profile', to: 'users#show', as: 'user_profile'
    ```
  - Explain the use of `*_path` and `*_url` helpers.

#### 6. Introduction to Rails API

- **Slide Title:** Introduction to Rails API
- **Content:**
  - Overview of Rails API and its purpose for building lightweight APIs.
  - Differences from traditional Rails applications (e.g., no views, middleware differences).

#### 7. Setting Up a Rails API

- **Slide Title:** Setting Up a Rails API
- **Content:**
  - How to create a new Rails API application:
    ```sh
    rails new my_api --api
    ```
  - Basic configuration and structure of a Rails API application.

#### 8. Routing in Rails API

- **Slide Title:** Routing in Rails API
- **Content:**
  - Defining routes similar to standard Rails applications.
  - Using namespaces for versioning:
    ```ruby
    namespace :api do
      namespace :v1 do
        resources :articles
      end
    end
    ```
  - Customizing API responses with serializers.
