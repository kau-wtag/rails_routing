### **Introduction to Rails Routing**

#### Content:

**1. What is Routing in Rails?**

- **Definition:**
  - Routing in Rails is the mechanism that connects web requests to the corresponding controller actions in the application.
- **Purpose:**
  - Direct HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific controller actions based on the URL pattern.
  - Manage URL patterns and their corresponding responses.

**2. Importance of Routing in Web Applications**

- **Key Role:**
  - Routes define how users interact with the application through URLs.
- **Structure:**
  - Provides a clear structure for the application's endpoints.
- **RESTful Design:**
  - Encourages RESTful design principles, making the application more organized and easier to maintain.

**3. Example of a Simple Route:**
```ruby
get 'welcome/index'
```
- **Explanation:**
  - This route maps the URL `/welcome/index` to the `index` action in the `WelcomeController`.

**4. Setting the Root Route:**
```ruby
root 'welcome#index'
```
- **Explanation:**
  - This sets the root URL (`/`) to go to the `index` action in the `WelcomeController`.

### Visuals:

1. **Diagram: Basic Routing Flow**
   - A simple flowchart showing an HTTP request coming in, the router directing it to a specific controller action, and the controller returning a response.

2. **Example URL Mapping:**
   - Visual representation of how the URL `/welcome/index` is mapped to `WelcomeController`'s `index` action.

### Slide Design Tips:

- **Title Font:** Large and bold for clarity.
- **Content Font:** Clear and concise, use bullet points for easy reading.
- **Colors:** Use a consistent color scheme that matches your presentation theme.
- **Code Snippets:** Use a monospaced font for code snippets, and consider highlighting key parts of the code.
- **Images/Diagrams:** Simple and relevant diagrams to illustrate routing concepts.
