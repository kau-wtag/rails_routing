### What Happens Without Migrations
Understanding the role and importance of migrations can be emphasized by discussing the challenges faced when migrations are not used. Here’s how you can include this section in your presentation:

### 10. What Happens Without Migrations

#### 1. Manual Database Changes
- **Error-Prone Process**:
  - Making manual changes to the database schema is prone to human error.
  - Typing mistakes or forgetting to update certain fields can lead to inconsistencies.
- **Lack of Consistency**:
  - Without migrations, there is no guarantee that the database schema is consistent across different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Difficulty in Collaboration**:
  - Team members might have different versions of the database schema, leading to integration issues and bugs.

#### 2. Version Control Issues
- **No Schema History**:
  - Without migrations, it’s hard to track changes made to the database schema over time.
  - Reverting to a previous schema state becomes complex without a history of changes.
- **Deployment Challenges**:
  - Deploying changes to the production database without a controlled, automated process increases the risk of downtime and data loss.
  
#### 3. Testing Problems
- **Inconsistent Test Environments**:
  - Ensuring that test environments match the production schema is difficult without migrations.
  - This can lead to tests passing in development but failing in production due to schema differences.

#### 4. Maintenance Difficulties
- **Hard to Reproduce Issues**:
  - Debugging issues related to the database schema becomes difficult if there’s no clear record of changes.
  - Developers may struggle to reproduce and fix bugs related to schema discrepancies.
- **Complex Rollbacks**:
  - Rolling back changes manually is risky and time-consuming. Without migrations, reverting to a previous schema state can be error-prone and complex.

### Example Scenarios Without Migrations

#### Scenario 1: Adding a Column
- **Manual Process**:
  - Developer A manually adds a new column to the users table in development.
  - Developer B pulls the latest code but doesn’t have the new column in their local database.
  - Integration tests fail because of the missing column, causing confusion and delays.

#### Scenario 2: Production Deployment
- **Manual Schema Update**:
  - During a production deployment, the database schema needs to be updated manually.
  - A critical column is forgotten, leading to application errors and potential downtime.
  - Rolling back the change requires manually reversing the schema update, increasing the risk of further issues.

### Benefits of Using Migrations

Reiterate the benefits of using migrations to highlight their importance:
- **Consistency**: Ensures the database schema is consistent across all environments.
- **Version Control**: Tracks changes to the database schema, making it easy to revert to previous states.
- **Automation**: Automates schema changes, reducing the risk of human error.
- **Collaboration**: Simplifies collaboration among team members by providing a shared history of schema changes.
- **Testing**: Ensures test environments match the production schema, leading to more reliable tests.
- **Maintenance**: Makes it easier to debug and fix issues related to the database schema.
